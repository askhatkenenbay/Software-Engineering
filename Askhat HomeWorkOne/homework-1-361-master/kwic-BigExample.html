'Then, by His own power alone He disposes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3207">ALL</a> things.' <br>
'Then, He disposes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3215">ALL</a> things by the agency of good, if it be true that <br>

<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_849">ALL</a> THINGS HAVE THEIR NEEDFUL ORDER <br>
'Why,' said she, 'since God is rightly believed to govern <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3229">ALL</a> things <br>

cried: 'O thou guide into the way of true light, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3448">ALL</a> that thy voice hath <br>

willed; whereas if there be no power, the will is <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3553">ALL</a> in vain. And so, <br>
therefore that, when happiness is sought, it is good which is in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3577">ALL</a> <br>
'Then, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3582">ALL</a> men, good and bad alike, with one indistinguishable purpose <br>

man, for one who is without good cannot properly be called good at <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3770">ALL</a> <br>

 Why <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4088">ALL</a> this furious strife? Oh, why <br>
originally instituted. Accordingly, I do exceedingly marvel why <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4118">ALL</a> this <br>

'Lastly, to think of a thing as being in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4903">ANY</a> way other than what it is, <br>

of the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5035">ANY</a> <br>

the truth of knowledge. Consequently, if anything is about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4905">BE</a> and <br>
multitude--and what can <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2370">BE</a> imagined more shameful than that? Nay, they <br>

there must needs <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2377">BE</a> many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single <br>

things no shadow of uncertainty can possibly <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4928">BE</a> found, then the <br>

volition, but by the necessity of what must surely <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4939">BE</a> And therefore <br>

possibly <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4945">BE</a> conceived. Again, no ground is left for hope or prayer, <br>
man--the communion of hope and prayer--if it <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4949">BE</a> true that we ever earn <br>

necessity of future events <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4955">BE</a> admitted, what means will there be whereby <br>
necessity of future events be admitted, what means will there <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4955">BE</a> whereby <br>
we may <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4956">BE</a> brought near and cleave to Him who is the supreme Head of all? <br>
Wherefore it needs must <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4957">BE</a> that the human race, even as thou didst <br>
 There may such lasting warfare <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4975">BE</a> <br>

is no reason why the beasts also should not <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2424">BE</a> happy, since all their <br>
of the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5035">BE</a> deemed any <br>

order that a preconception may <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5057">BE</a> a sign of this necessity. Otherwise, <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5059">BE</a> a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof <br>
established on firm grounds of reason must <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5060">BE</a> drawn not from signs and <br>
can it <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5062">BE</a> that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why, <br>
foresees to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5064">BE</a> coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing <br>

come to pass, but that what is about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4871">COME</a> to pass must necessarily be <br>
do not <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4890">COME</a> to pass because they are foreseen, still, all the same, <br>
to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4892">COME</a> to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should happen, and <br>
events because they are about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4896">COME</a> to pass, what is it but to think <br>
_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things foreknown <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4900">COME</a> to pass <br>
about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4913">COME</a> to pass? For if He thinks of events which possibly may not <br>
happen at all as inevitably destined to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4914">COME</a> to pass, He is deceived; <br>
they are in such a sense as to know that they may equally <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4917">COME</a> to pass <br>

foreknown cannot fail to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5038">COME</a> to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to <br>
can it be that things foreseen should ever fail to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5062">COME</a> to pass? Why, <br>
that, although they should <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5065">COME</a> to pass, yet there was no necessity <br>
to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5077">COME</a> <br>
were about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5080">COME</a> to pass before they were actually happening. Such <br>
that are about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5084">COME</a> But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in <br>
certainly about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5248">COME</a> to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of <br>
hold on things to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5312">COME</a> not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which <br>
no beginning in time,[S] and to be destined never to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5320">COME</a> to an end. For <br>
beholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5366">COME</a> to <br>
one mental view distinguishes alike what will <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5368">COME</a> necessarily and what <br>
time. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5375">COME</a> <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5379">COME</a> to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to <br>
come to pass cannot fail to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5379">COME</a> to pass, and that what cannot fail to <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5380">COME</a> to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word <br>
things will <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5401">COME</a> to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of <br>
have <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5405">COME</a> to pass. <br>
through their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5408">COME</a> to pass <br>
doubt exist, but some of them <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5415">COME</a> from the necessity of things, others <br>
office? For, as we said just now, that which hath no true <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2268">COMELINESS</a> of <br>
indeed, that the sweetness of wife and children should be right <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2426">COMELY</a> <br>

<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2910">COMES</a> to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge <br>

ability." Nor do I wish to deny it; only this ability of theirs <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3678">COMES</a> <br>
ceases to be; whence it <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3802">COMES</a> to pass that the bad cease to be what they <br>

change something which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5423">COMES</a> within its foreknowledge." My answer is: <br>

Then, as if making a new beginning, she thus discoursed: 'The <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4204">COMING</a> <br>

only able to do <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3684">EVIL</a> <br>
'But that same highest good cannot do <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3694">EVIL</a> <br>
'Yet they are able to do <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3702">EVIL</a> <br>
do <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3707">EVIL</a> also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that they who can do <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3708">EVIL</a> have less power. There is this also: we have shown that all power <br>

<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3791">EVIL</a> As, then, righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous, so <br>
is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3793">EVIL</a> <br>
 High place without virtue is an <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1023">EVIL</a> not a good. Power is an empty <br>
they are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3899">EVIL</a> <br>
to have been able to accomplish <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3900">EVIL</a> is more wretched; for without the <br>
all events, puts an end to the <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3917">EVIL</a> doings of the wicked, I should <br>

Then said she: 'Have we not agreed that the good are happy, and the <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3946">EVIL</a> <br>

good; and likewise, when they escape punishment, a new <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3966">EVIL</a> attaches to <br>
acknowledged to be an <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3968">EVIL</a> in the case of the unrighteous.' <br>
 paradox of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1906">EVIL</a> is introduced, and he is once more perplexed. <br>
wonder in myself whether there is not some good and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4110">EVIL</a> in fortune as <br>
done for the sake of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4273">EVIL</a> even by the wicked themselves; for, as we <br>
themselves suffer at the hands of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4367">EVIL</a> are inflamed with <br>
alone to which things <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4370">EVIL</a> are also good, in that, by putting them to <br>
banishes all <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4384">EVIL</a> from the borders of His commonweal through the links <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_654">EVIL</a> purposes are, perchance, due to the imperfection of human nature; <br>
exists, whence comes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_658">EVIL</a> Yet whence comes good, if He exists not?" <br>
all <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3796">EVILS</a> has not only touched, but deeply tainted? <br>
disposing providence, thou wilt nowhere find the <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4386">EVILS</a> which are <br>

some strange new thing <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_491">HAD</a> befallen? Thinkest thou that now, for the <br>
pieces the garment which I <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_499">HAD</a> woven with my own hands, and, clutching <br>
diverse things. And when it <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3183">HAD</a> once come together, the very diversity <br>
the torn pieces, went off, believing that the whole of me <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_500">HAD</a> passed <br>

that men alone <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_895">HAD</a> no portion in the divine care. As to the rest, thou <br>
Accordingly, when I <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_478">HAD</a> lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, I <br>
Republic <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1685">HAD</a> not yet crossed the Caucasus, and yet by that time her <br>

 Death's dark hour <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_321">HAD</a> all but whelmed me <br>
this sort of arrogance. A certain man assailed one who <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1717">HAD</a> put on the <br>

Thereafter for awhile she remained silent; and when she <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1039">HAD</a> restored my <br>
conscience, I have <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_587">HAD</a> to think nothing of giving offence to the <br>
brute beasts? Why, suppose, now, one who <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4021">HAD</a> quite lost his sight <br>
should likewise forget that he <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4022">HAD</a> ever possessed the faculty of vision, <br>

moreover, had been torn by the hands of violent persons, who <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_355">HAD</a> each <br>

the loss of which thou lamentest <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1141">HAD</a> been thine, thou couldst never have <br>

digging, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4727">HAD</a> not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise <br>
flowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4735">HAD</a> some <br>

that, even if there <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5053">HAD</a> been no foreknowledge, the issues would have <br>
few. <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_678">HAD</a> I been accused of a design to fire the temples, to slaughter <br>

nourishment which is mine to give, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_439">HAD</a> grown up to the full vigour of a <br>
manly spirit? And yet I <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_440">HAD</a> bestowed such armour on thee as would have <br>

providence foresees to be about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4855">HAPPEN</a> must necessarily come to pass. <br>
Even if future events are foreseen because they are about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4889">HAPPEN</a> and <br>
to come to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4892">HAPPEN</a> and <br>

that it will necessarily <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5052">HAPPEN</a> Granted; but in this case it is plain <br>
beforehand that all things, without exception, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5056">HAPPEN</a> of necessity in <br>
foresees to be coming were not about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5064">HAPPEN</a> instead of our supposing <br>
to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5077">HAPPEN</a> without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come <br>

things will come to pass which God foreknows as about to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5401">HAPPEN</a> but of <br>

 makes their <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4658">HAPPENING</a> necessary. We may, however, if we please, <br>
were about to come to pass before they were actually <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5080">HAPPENING</a> Such <br>
process. And when this <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1437">HAPPENS</a> they must needs impoverish those whom <br>
had already abolished the kingly title! And if, as <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1568">HAPPENS</a> but rarely, <br>

it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1368">HAPPINESS</a> by reason of <br>
how poor is a <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1371">HAPPINESS</a> which depends on the blindness of ignorance! If <br>

cannot be doubted but that, if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1380">HAPPINESS</a> is conferred in this way, the <br>

also it appears that it is <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2918">HAPPINESS</a> alone which is sought. From all <br>

we rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3246">HAPPINESS</a> <br>

she wears the guise of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1788">HAPPINESS</a> and most seems to caress, is always <br>

 whether <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1866">HAPPINESS</a> can really be secured in any of these ways, (_a_) <br>

 necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1889">HAPPINESS</a> <br>
 the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1893">HAPPINESS</a> it <br>
 is plain that this good and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1894">HAPPINESS</a> are in essence the same.--CH. <br>

and anxiety because thy <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1325">HAPPINESS</a> falls short of completeness. Why, who <br>

 All these dainties <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2094">HE</a> will spurn, <br>
 Only for the woods <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2096">HE</a> longs, <br>

character with his fortune, perchance grows alarmed lest <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4354">HE</a> should come <br>
to mourn the loss of that whose possession is so pleasant to him. <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4355">HE</a> <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4357">HE</a> forsakes his iniquity. Some, through a prosperity unworthily borne, <br>

 With their fierce lord's own flesh <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4599">HE</a> fed <br>

<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4881">HE</a> is really seated, he must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case, <br>
he is really seated, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4881">HE</a> must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case, <br>

 Yet once <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_403">HE</a> ranged the open heavens, <br>
 <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2405">HE</a> shut a soul--a heaven-born soul--within the body's frame; <br>

power; <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2621">HE</a> prefers a mean and low estate, and also denies himself many <br>
pleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2622">HE</a> has gained. <br>
But at this rate <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2623">HE</a> does not even attain to independence--a weakling <br>
sensitive is <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1340">HE</a> and, unless all things answer to his whim, he is <br>
obscurity. <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2625">HE</a> again, who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth, <br>
sensitive is he; and, unless all things answer to his whim, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1340">HE</a> is <br>

Sometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries, that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2628">HE</a> is gnawed by <br>

just as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5363">HE</a> <br>
lay hold of that one which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2634">HE</a> makes his aim.' <br>
'Suppose anyone desire to obtain them together, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2638">HE</a> does indeed wish for <br>

time. Whence <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5375">IT</a> follows that when it perceives that something will come <br>
and this <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4915">IT</a> is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to <br>
repute, but by the truth of inner conviction? And if at all <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2374">IT</a> does seem <br>
a fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2375">IT</a> follows that any <br>
failure so to spread <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2376">IT</a> is held foul. But if, as I set forth but now, <br>
only precious when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1432">IT</a> is given away, and, by being transferred to <br>

of a frail and imperfect kind, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2775">IT</a> cannot be doubted but there is also a <br>
human design, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4943">IT</a> comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the <br>
from the merits of ancestors. But if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2386">IT</a> is the praise which brings <br>
renown, of necessity <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2387">IT</a> is they who are praised that are famous. <br>

not the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5051">IT</a> is a sign <br>

therefore really just the reverse of that which Boethius makes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2440">IT</a> See <br>
can <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5062">IT</a> be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why, <br>
thou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances. If <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1289">IT</a> is the <br>

which could be cognized by no other than itself. For <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5119">IT</a> cognizes the <br>

 So that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_419">IT</a> blossoms with the rose <br>

that nothing is wretched, but thinking makes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1347">IT</a> so, and conversely every <br>

evil. As, then, righteousness <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3791">ITSELF</a> is the reward of the righteous, so <br>

former <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5391">NECESSITY</a> is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by <br>

goodness never lacks its reward, nor crime its <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3762">PUNISHMENT</a> For, verily, <br>
man cannot doubt that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3787">PUNISHMENT</a> is inseparable from the bad. For since <br>
good and bad, and likewise reward and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3788">PUNISHMENT</a> are contraries, it <br>

unrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3996">PUNISHMENT</a> than <br>
are supposed to escape <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3999">PUNISHMENT</a> <br>
for <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4015">PUNISHMENT</a> from one without thee--thine own act hath degraded thee, <br>

'Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4031">PUNISHMENT</a> <br>

wickedness itself is the <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3792">PUNISHMENT</a> of the unrighteous. Now, no one who <br>
disciplines or amends, is <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4560">PUNISHMENT</a> <br>
'Thou dost not doubt, then, that those who deserve <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4039">PUNISHMENT</a> are <br>

 follows that rewards and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4640">PUNISHMENTS</a> are unjust as well as useless; <br>

mind's tranquillity. But it is time for <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1056">THEE</a> to take and drain a <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1052">THEE</a> thou usedst to assail her in manly terms, to rebuke her, with <br>
for punishment from one without thee--thine own act hath degraded <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4015">THEE</a> <br>
the vile earth and upon the heavens, though all without <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4017">THEE</a> stand <br>

she loaded thee with caresses, when she deluded <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1068">THEE</a> with the <br>

since, even when she was still with <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1051">THEE</a> even while she was caressing <br>
brought <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1075">THEE</a> tranquillity. Thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one <br>

she loaded <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1068">THEE</a> with caresses, when she deluded thee with the <br>

honeyed sweetness of music and rhetoric. But <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1206">THEIR</a> charm lasts only <br>
in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1427">THEIR</a> own? What are they but mere gold and heaps of money? Yet these <br>

will suffer to be vexed with sore afflictions to confirm <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4329">THEIR</a> virtues <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4335">THEIR</a> sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue cannot <br>
reverence on account of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2238">THEIR</a> office, whom we deem unworthy of the <br>
universe, but <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4009">THEIR</a> own dispositions of mind, they think the license to <br>

the minds of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2228">THEIR</a> possessors, and drive out vice? Nay, they are rather <br>
 downfall of kings and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1872">THEIR</a> ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their <br>
discrimination <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5217">THEIR</a> own mental activities instead of conforming to <br>
laws are not unrighteous, since <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5449">THEIR</a> rewards and punishments are held <br>
not to be forgotten. Those who can go to the original will find <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_94">THEIR</a> <br>
things, however much foreknown, are in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5081">THEIR</a> occurrence _free_. For even <br>
into the hands of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4073">THEIR</a> accusers and judges. Whence it comes to pass <br>
under my control. My handmaidens know <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1139">THEIR</a> mistress; with me they come, <br>
 Too blest the former age, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1526">THEIR</a> life <br>
have men in real life such soundness of mind that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4281">THEIR</a> judgments of <br>

 <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1404">THEIR</a> burden to sustain. <br>
bring renown to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2015">THEIR</a> name. So it is on these ends, then, that the aim <br>
Why, on this very point <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4283">THEIR</a> verdicts conflict, and those whom some <br>
beautiful in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1477">THEIR</a> own nature, what is that to thee? They would have <br>
that God and man alike agree in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4312">THEIR</a> judgments about him; yet is he <br>
but at <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_653">THEIR</a> achievement of their hopes I do exceedingly marvel. For <br>
easily be clear to anyone who passes in review <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4213">THEIR</a> respective <br>
involved in their own nature compelling <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5066">THEIR</a> occurrence. Take an <br>
have strength to bear; others despise overmuch that to which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4331">THEIR</a> <br>
also <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4857">THEIR</a> designs and purposes, there can be no freedom of the will, <br>
is no reason why the beasts also should not be happy, since all <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2424">THEIR</a> <br>
or if it should so befall that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_576">THEIR</a> rulers would turn philosophers." By <br>
Accordingly, if they were but willing to weigh <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3794">THEIR</a> own case, could <br>
may be <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1442">THEIR</a> splendour, remember the flashing light is in the jewels, <br>
never without the proper penalties of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3992">THEIR</a> unrighteousness; to teach <br>
exercised a wider influence in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_85">THEIR</a> time. It has been translated into <br>
fine things show <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1428">THEIR</a> quality better in the spending than in the <br>
for instance, in guiding and turning <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5069">THEIR</a> cars, and so on. Now, is any <br>
their loss or find joy in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1476">THEIR</a> continued possession? While if they are <br>
wise alone are able to do what they would, while the wicked follow <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3716">THEIR</a> <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5412">THEIR</a> occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3038">THEIR</a> own accord hasten to destruction. For every creature diligently <br>
win the reverence of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2004">THEIR</a> fellow-citizens by the attainment of official <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2887">THEIR</a> summit and crown?' <br>
their age, the example of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1308">THEIR</a> father's and grandfather's character <br>
very act of supplication, even before they obtain <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4953">THEIR</a> petitions. Then, <br>
even, which, with <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1700">THEIR</a> authors, are overtaken by the dimness of age <br>
 Dulls the soul and blunts the senses, though <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5278">THEIR</a> forms be different. <br>
 'Tis but because <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4099">THEIR</a> lands and laws are not the same. <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2013">THEIR</a> aims; for instance, some want riches for the sake of pleasure and <br>
and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1307">THEIR</a> consular dignity--how in them, so far as may be in youths of <br>
and <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1447">THEIR</a> own brilliancy, still they in no wise merit your admiration <br>
we are minded to give things <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5340">THEIR</a> right names, we shall follow Plato in <br>
polluted minds vent <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3891">THEIR</a> rage in the destruction of the good, I would <br>
forth heat. But since this effect is not due to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2260">THEIR</a> own efficacy, but <br>
the bad? Surely <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2233">THEIR</a> unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their <br>
exile is to them that dwell therein <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1346">THEIR</a> native land. So true is it <br>
 Chance <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4763">THEIR</a> random way may steer. <br>
 In <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4458">THEIR</a> orbits to revolve, <br>
things which by <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4241">THEIR</a> nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly <br>
fact of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5403">THEIR</a> existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue <br>
win or hold; nay, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3652">THEIR</a> failure concerns the very sum and crown of <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2272">THEIR</a> splendour through time's changes, if they come into contempt <br>
 No skill was <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1531">THEIRS</a> the luscious grape <br>
 Not <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1538">THEIRS</a> to cleave the deep, nor seek <br>
ability." Nor do I wish to deny it; only this ability of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3678">THEIRS</a> comes <br>
the performance of good. So this ability of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3681">THEIRS</a> proves them still <br>
absolute freedom naturally <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5400">THEIRS</a> Accordingly, without doubt, all <br>
who will even listen to such arguments, let alone admit <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4003">THEM</a> to be <br>
alone to which things evil are also good, in that, by putting <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4370">THEM</a> to <br>
happy by its presence when it makes <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1384">THEM</a> not wretched by its loss?' <br>
plenitude brings them low, ofttimes involves <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2322">THEM</a> in its fall? Nero <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3648">THEM</a> What if they were left without this mighty, this well-nigh <br>
they are unable to get <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3899">THEM</a> fulfilled. If it is wretched to will evil, <br>
the souls of men certainly die not with <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1377">THEM</a> and convinced thereof by <br>
to which thou hast brought <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3259">THEM</a> but most of all at these very words <br>
is in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1475">THEM</a> no beauty to be desired, why shouldst thou either grieve for <br>
in thy riches, but rather thou hast chosen to count <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1480">THEM</a> in thy riches <br>
diligence to prevent any of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3050">THEM</a> dying, so long as it is possible for <br>
end. Truly, if either wealth, rank, or any of the rest, bring with <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2126">THEM</a> <br>
air and water yield easily to what divides <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3068">THEM</a> but swiftly flow back <br>

it fitting to pass <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_830">THEM</a> over lightly, because the popular voice hath <br>
the other delivers <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1792">THEM</a> by the knowledge of the frail nature of <br>
mind--first I lost <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3162">THEM</a> through the clogging contact of the body; then <br>
likewise disposeth all things, and guides <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4382">THEM</a> to good; and while He <br>
things do in the end take on <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1446">THEM</a> more beauty from their Maker's care <br>
of those who exercise <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1570">THEM</a> that pleases. So it appears that honour <br>
vesture were seen upon <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_502">THEM</a> were destroyed through the mistake of the <br>
'Suppose anyone desire to obtain <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2638">THEM</a> together, he does indeed wish for <br>
beneficent strength disposed of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3264">THEM</a> also, as they deserved. But shall <br>
the performance of good. So this ability of theirs proves <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3681">THEM</a> still <br>
their occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5412">THEM</a> <br>
make <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1613">THEM</a> worthy, but contrarily reveals and displays their <br>
mistake, ties and binds <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4932">THEM</a> down to one only issue. But this admission <br>
what is there in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1424">THEM</a> capable of ever becoming truly thine, or which <br>
safe from all this wild work, laugh to see <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_519">THEM</a> making prize of the most <br>

with contempt by drawing more attention to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2251">THEM</a> But not without <br>
suitable use, it bringeth <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4371">THEM</a> in the end to some good issue. For order <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3051">THEM</a> to continue alive. Why do they all draw their nourishment from <br>

they know what they ought to follow, but lust drives <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3663">THEM</a> aside out of <br>

as in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_497">THEM</a> lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were <br>
of setting <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_364">THEM</a> free. Now, were it some common man whom your allurements <br>

up of various parts, or is there some one of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2870">THEM</a> which forms the full <br>

mind's living fire to suppress <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4191">THEM</a> For there come within its scope the <br>
 Hast <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2367">THEM</a> raised high in pride the base-born churl!" <br>

lewd multitude, who falsely deemed <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_503">THEM</a> to be my disciples. It may be <br>
added to <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3965">THEM</a> wit, the punishment which by the law of justice is <br>
none of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1618">THEM</a> rightly so called. Finally, we may draw the same conclusion <br>
and their consular dignity--how in <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1307">THEM</a> so far as may be in youths of <br>
she is scheming to entrap them--how she unexpectedly abandons <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1046">THEM</a> and <br>

possible for <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3082">THEM</a> to continue living. Wherefore in no way mayst thou <br>
doubt but thou canst make <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3538">THEM</a> good: only keep me not in suspense after <br>

'Nay, truly,' said she, 'great are these penalties, some of <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3986">THEM</a> <br>

charges innumerable with which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_593">THEY</a> were for ever being harassed by the <br>

for continuance: <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3081">THEY</a> must desire life, so long as it is naturally <br>
 <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2529">THEY</a> seek for that which reacheth far beyond <br>
 Fall the leaves; <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_756">THEY</a> reappear, <br>

members composing happiness, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2893">THEY</a> would differ severally one from the <br>
guilt, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_688">THEY</a> falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition I had <br>

settled as <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_509">THEY</a> were in my principles, their lives were a manifest <br>
'Anything but that; <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4526">THEY</a> deem it to be the best, as indeed it is.' <br>
'But if the bad were to attain the good which is _their_ object, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3595">THEY</a> <br>

on in their wilfulness fancying they will attain what <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3718">THEY</a> wish for in <br>

their splendour through time's changes, if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2272">THEY</a> come into contempt <br>
and seasons <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_516">THEY</a> set in array against us, and fall on in overwhelming <br>
 Heaven's swift globe, and, as <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_738">THEY</a> roam, <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3910">THEY</a> themselves think likely; since, verily, within the narrow bounds of <br>
 The sea's far depths <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2518">THEY</a> know, <br>
both frighten others from crime, and amend those on whom <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4344">THEY</a> are <br>
knowledge; but if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5418">THEY</a> are considered in themselves, they are free from <br>
nothing, 'tis clear that the wicked can effect nothing, since <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3683">THEY</a> are <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2464">THEY</a> cannot guide anyone to the promised goal. Now, I will very briefly <br>
and at my going <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1140">THEY</a> depart. I might boldly affirm that if those things <br>
this puzzle. For <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4866">THEY</a> say that it is not because God has foreseen the <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5087">THEY</a> are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no <br>
there is a necessity, both that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4891">THEY</a> should be foreseen by God as about <br>
they are in such a sense as to know that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4917">THEY</a> may equally come to pass <br>
 All this <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2523">THEY</a> know full well. <br>
'Surely, then, the wicked, when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3964">THEY</a> are punished, have a good thing <br>

incontinence, for <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3665">THEY</a> cannot fight against vice. Or do they knowingly <br>
but that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3672">THEY</a> _are_ in an unqualified and absolute sense I deny. Just as <br>
 'As,' say <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5154">THEY</a> 'the pen its marks <br>
allow the vicious to be bad, but that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3674">THEY</a> _are_ in an absolute sense I <br>

done, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4364">THEY</a> judge ought not to have been done. Hence it is that this <br>
wise alone are able to do what <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3716">THEY</a> would, while the wicked follow their <br>
on in their wilfulness fancying <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3718">THEY</a> will attain what they wish for in <br>
the paths of delight; but <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3719">THEY</a> are very far from its attainment, since <br>
the good must be happy for the very reason that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3783">THEY</a> are good. But it <br>
which they help to promote the slavery in which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4805">THEY</a> are involved, and <br>
return home. Think you <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2038">THEY</a> are wrong who strive to escape want? Nay, <br>
 <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1021">THEY</a> can never truly be our own. Man cannot find his good in <br>

as far as their nature admits, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3045">THEY</a> cannot quickly wither and die. Some <br>
rather of pity, so, and much more, should <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4078">THEY</a> be pitied whose minds are <br>
do evil also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3707">THEY</a> who can do <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3899">THEY</a> are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will evil, <br>
 all created beings seek. <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1860">THEY</a> aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or <br>
because <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1481">THEY</a> seemed to thee precious. <br>
 gladness of heart, in one or other of which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1864">THEY</a> severally imagine <br>
 bound up one with the other, and, if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1885">THEY</a> are to be attained at <br>
were, while only the outward aspect is still left to show <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3803">THEY</a> have been <br>
it is clear that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2247">THEY</a> do not possess the true beauty of dignity. And <br>
to come to pass, and that when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4892">THEY</a> are foreseen they should happen, and <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1438">THEY</a> leave. How poor and cramped a thing, then, is riches, which more <br>
forsake the common end of all things that are, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3668">THEY</a> likewise also cease <br>
 pleasure, because <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1862">THEY</a> think thereby to attain either (_a_) <br>
universe, but their own dispositions of mind, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4009">THEY</a> think the license to <br>
the fact is so. I do not, indeed, deny that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3671">THEY</a> who are bad are bad, <br>
 suffering punishment than when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3421">THEY</a> escape unpunished. (e) The <br>

even assent to this, either--that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4025">THEY</a> who do wrong are more wretched <br>
and power, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1597">THEY</a> would never come to the utterly bad, since opposites are <br>
process. And when this happens, <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1437">THEY</a> must needs impoverish those whom <br>
own hearts' lust, but can _not_ accomplish what <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3717">THEY</a> would. For they go <br>
see that by the pains of punishment <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4069">THEY</a> would rid themselves of the <br>
properly due only to mischievous citizens on whose account <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4117">THEY</a> were <br>
 Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1891">THEY</a> <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4804">THEY</a> are disturbed by baneful affections, by yielding and assenting to <br>

 <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3419">THEY</a> accomplish their desires than when they fail to attain them. <br>
when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2990">THEY</a> are gathered, as it were, into one form and agency, so that <br>
with the triumphal largesses for which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1235">THEY</a> looked--methinks thou didst <br>

works, and the medium on which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5745">THEY</a> may be stored, may contain <br>
excellences, it is obvious that <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2022">THEY</a> are to be ranged with the above. <br>
self-sufficing. Do <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2041">THEY</a> fall into error who deem that which is best to <br>
to do with it. So, then, if dignities cannot win men reverence, if <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2270">THEY</a> <br>
<a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4280">THEY</a> like and what they loathe come alternately to the bad!" Yes; but <br>
 they accomplish their desires than when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3419">THEY</a> fail to attain them. <br>
whom <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_4369">THEY</a> hate, return to the ways of virtue. It is the Divine power <br>
good; and likewise, when <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3966">THEY</a> escape punishment, a new evil attaches to <br>
inferences from their demonstrations to which <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2850">THEY</a> give the name <br>

the blessings men wish to win; <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_2053">THEY</a> want riches, rank, sovereignty, <br>
Then said I: 'This is very true. I see that the vicious, though <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_3888">THEY</a> <br>
many varied pursuits, though <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_1991">THEY</a> take many paths, yet strive to reach <br>

illustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many <a href="BigExampleExample.html#line_5067">THINGS</a> <br>
